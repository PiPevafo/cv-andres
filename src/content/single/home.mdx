Welcome! My name is Kevin Giraldo, and I am a final-year undergraduate student in Physics at the University of Valle in Cali, Colombia. On this website you can find my research interests, a list of my draft study notes and talk slides, as well as several independent projects I have carried out. Feel free to reach out and contact me here.

Here is my <a href={frontmatter.url} target="_blank">CV ({frontmatter.updated})</a>.
