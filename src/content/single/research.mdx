This page highlights research interests in the physics of complex quantum systems, covering areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum simulation, and quantum information. It includes references to publications, presentations, and ongoing projects, along with a brief overview of the research focus.

Now with latex support! $E=mc^2$. As a more complex example,

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(x,t) + V(x)\Psi(x,t)$$
