# {frontmatter.title}

I am interested in a variety of topics in the physics of complex quantum systems including topics in Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Simulation, and Quantum Information. I am currently at the University of Pennsylvania and am co-advised by Professor Martin Claassen and Professor Eugene J. Mele. I am supported by a NSF GRFP Fellowship.

See here for my publications, here for my slides, or below for a description of my research.


Now with latex support! $E=mc^2$. As a more complex example,

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi(x,t) + V(x)\Psi(x,t)$$
