			<h1>Projects</h1>
			<p>I find that projects, while not constituting original research, are a fun way to familiarize myself with different fields and their contemporary and historical methods.  Below you can find descriptions of a variety of projects I have completed either independently, in preface to research, or as a substantial project in a course.</p>
